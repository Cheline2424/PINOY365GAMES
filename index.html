                <div class="space-y-6 text-gray-400 leading-relaxed text-justify">
                    <p>At <strong>Pinoy365</strong>, we adhere to the principle of data minimization, meaning we only gather information that is absolutely essential for the operational integrity of the platform and the safety of our player community. The data collection process begins the moment you initiate the <strong>Pinoy365 register</strong> protocol or access our landing pages.</p>
                    
                    <h3 class="text-white font-bold uppercase text-sm tracking-tighter">A. Detailed Personal Identifiers</h3>
                    <p>To establish a unique gaming identity, we require specific personal data such as your active mobile number. This is the primary key for your <strong>Pinoy365 login</strong>, used for high-security One-Time Password (OTP) verifications and as a destination for essential account recovery services. Furthermore, any profile details you choose to supplement—such as nicknames or preferred communication settings—are stored securely to personalize your interface.</p>
                    
                    <h3 class="text-white font-bold uppercase text-sm tracking-tighter">B. Comprehensive Usage & Device Intelligence</h3>
                    <p>Every time you interact with our servers, our system logs technical parameters. This includes your Internet Protocol (IP) address, which helps us detect and prevent multi-accounting fraud. We also collect browser-specific data, operating system versions, and unique device identifiers to ensure that the <strong>Pinoy365 app</strong> renders perfectly on your hardware, whether you are using a flagship Android device or an iOS platform.</p>
                    
                    <h3 class="text-white font-bold uppercase text-sm tracking-tighter">C. Transactional Transparency</h3>
                    <p>For financial integrity and anti-money laundering compliance, we maintain an exhaustive history of your deposit and withdrawal activities via GCash, Maya, or other linked e-wallets. This includes timestamps, amounts, and transaction reference numbers, ensuring that every cent of your winnings is accounted for and traceable.</p>

This includes payment gateway processors like <strong>GCash</strong> and <strong>Maya</strong> for secure funds handling, and advanced analytics tools to measure platform performance. These entities only receive the specific data points required to perform their designated tasks and are contractually bound to maintain the same high level of data privacy as Pinoy365. We categorically state that we <strong class="text-white underline italic">never</strong> sell or expose your personal data to external parties for profit.

This is a vital safeguard against account takeovers.</p>
